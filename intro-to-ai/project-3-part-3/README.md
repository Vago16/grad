Important files:
    inhand_train.py: trains deep q learning agent and outputs both dqn_agent.pth, which is the agent, dqn_training_log.txt which has episodes and total reward accumulated after each episode

    inhand_test.py: tests according to rubric specifications, outputs to dqb_test_results.txt the episode, reward, and if the test was a success or failure for each episode

    dqn_agent.pth: deep q learning agent

    dqn_training_log.txt: contains episodes and total reward accumulated after each episode

    dqb_test_results.txt: contains the episode, reward, and if the test was a success or failure for each episode

    test.MOV: video of output of inhand_test.py


NOTES:
    I was not able to record a video as the functions required to access the GUI are not supported anymore for MacOS.  I instead switched to a fully command line version of the model instead.  Please run inhand_test.py to see the performance of the deep q learning agent.  I also included a video of the terminal print statements as the training is occurring.
