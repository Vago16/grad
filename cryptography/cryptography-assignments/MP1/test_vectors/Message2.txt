Cryptography employs two main types of encryption: symmetric and asymmetric. Symmetric encryption uses a single, shared secret key for both encrypting and decrypting data. Think of it like a locked box with only one key that both sender and receiver possess. Algorithms like AES are highly efficient for securing large amounts of data.

Asymmetric encryption, or public key cryptography, uses a pair of mathematically related keys: a public key and a private key. The public key can be widely shared, used to encrypt data, but only the corresponding private key can decrypt it. RSA is a common example. This system is crucial for secure key exchange in symmetric encryption, digital signatures, and enabling secure communication protocols like HTTPS, which powers much of the internet.
