Cryptographic hash functions take any input data and produce a fixed size output, like a digital fingerprint. This output, known as a hash value or message digest, is unique to the input. Even a tiny change in the original data will result in a completely different hash, making them vital for verifying data integrity and detecting tampering. They are designed to be "one way," meaning it's computationally infeasible to reverse the process and find the original input from the hash
