Key management is paramount in cryptography. It involves securely generating, storing, distributing, using, and revoking cryptographic keys. A strong encryption algorithm is useless if its keys are compromised. Proper key management practices are essential for maintaining the confidentiality and integrity of encrypted data, ensuring that only authorized individuals can access or alter information.
