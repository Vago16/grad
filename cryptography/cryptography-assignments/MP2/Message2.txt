It's easy to confuse quantum cryptography with post-quantum cryptography, but they're distinct. Quantum cryptography, like Quantum Key Distribution, uses the principles of quantum mechanics to establish a theoretically unhackable shared secret key. Any attempt to eavesdrop on the key exchange would disturb the quantum state, immediately alerting the parties. It's about how keys are exchanged.

Post-quantum cryptography, on the other hand, refers to cryptographic algorithms that are designed to be secure against attacks from future large-scale quantum computers, which could break many of the public-key algorithms used today. PQC algorithms run on classical computers but are built to resist quantum attacks. It's about new algorithms to replace current vulnerable ones.
